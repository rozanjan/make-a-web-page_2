       <H2> LESSON ONE: Basics of Web and HTML  </H2> </div> 
       <div class="concept-title"> <b> The World Wide Web </b> </div>  
         <p>
The World Wide Web is a collection of document pages stored on computers called servers.  Individual computers can access Web pages through the internet using http.  Http is the address that tell the server how to locate the web page. The <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496"> Udacity  Video </a>  provides a nice introduction to the web. </p>
               <div class="concept-title">
         <b>HTML</b> </div> 
<p>HTML is the coding language that most of the pages on the web are written in.  The full name for HTML is hypertext markup language. 
Tags are shortcuts that tell the browser how to display a page. Html is written by having an opening tag, then the contents and then the closing tag.  Tags can be <b>inline </b> such as <span class="italic"> a, span, br, ing, stong </span> or <b> block </b> <span class= "italic"> div, p, form </span>.  Inline means the code works within the line and block means it draws an invisible block around the text. </P> <div>
        <div class="concept-title"> 
           <b>Stupid Computers</b> </div>
<p>Another main point to remember is that computers take everything literal. A little typo can mess up the entire page.  </p>  </div>
   <div class="lesson">
     <H2>  LESSON TWO:  Creating Structured Documents </H2> </div>
           <div class="concept-title">
         <b> Web Development </b> </div>  <p>
Web pages can consist of three programming languages. HTML controls the structure of the page. CSS controls the style of the page.  Java Script controls the interactive components. </p>
          <div class="concept-title">
         <b> Tree Structure </b> </div> <p>
  Html is written in a tree like structure. Each box of code branches out into other branches. This tree like structure is also called DOM (Document Object Model).  Html is written in a wave of indentation on the left side of a document. An element is considered deepely nested if it is more indented inside it's box. </p>

    </H2>  </div> 
       <div class="concept-title">
         <b> Avoid Repetition</b> </div> <p>
      Avoiding repetition is important to avoid errors. If you are writing the same code over and over it is very easy to make errors. If then you want to change the code, every line of repetition must be changed to avoid problems.   Avoiding repetition is also important to maintain consistency when you are adding style elements. <p> 
           <div class="concept-title">
         <b> CSS </b>  </div> <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way of adding style to a web page. Elements on a page are named and then the style such a font, color, etc can be applied to the elements. </p>
